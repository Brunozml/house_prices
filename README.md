# Supervised Learning: Predicting House Prices Across Italy

ðŸ’¡ The goal of the project is to predict house prices in different Italian cities using the following datasets:
- In `train.csv` you will find a set of rows, each containing data for one apartment for sale. The target variable that you have to predict is the sale price.
- `poi.csv` contains the coordinates of points of insterest that you can use to further enrich the features available in your training dataset.

Metric: Submissions were evaluated on Mean-Squared-Error (MSE) between the predicted value and the observed sales price
